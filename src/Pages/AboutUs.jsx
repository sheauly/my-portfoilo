                        <p>
                            Hello! I'm <span className="text-lime-400 font-semibold">Sheauly Akhter</span>, a passionate and enthusiastic MERN Stack Developer from Kishoregonj, Bangladesh. I have completed my Masterâ€™s degree and have been deeply involved in the world of web development ever since.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My programming journey began out of curiosity and quickly turned into a strong passion. I started with basic HTML & CSS, then gradually moved on to JavaScript and React. With time, I explored backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I truly enjoy solving real-world problems through code. Whether it's building a full-stack application from scratch or optimizing frontend performance, I love every step of the development process. Clean, responsive UI and UX design are especially close to my heart.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Outside of programming, I love listening to music, traveling, and occasionally painting. These hobbies help me stay creative and bring fresh ideas into my coding life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm excited about collaborating with other developers, working on innovative projects, and making a positive impact through technology. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me!
                        </p>
